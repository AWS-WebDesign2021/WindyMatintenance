  <h3>About This Webpage </h3>
<p>This web page is meant to be a fun Buzzfeed-style quiz that a user can fill out
   to discover what nail style is best for them based on the questions that they answer.
    Java Script was uses for the first time to have the quiz show a result based on the
    information the user imputes. This web page also features an animated title that
    bounces, and many images. This site is a lot like the pages that I can create
    today, and it has more sophisticated elements. While creating this one I had
    many difficulties in the code which was a big learning experience for me.
    Looking back I could have take more time to space the questions and the images
    properly, as well as the GIF logo. I hope that the user can have a fun time
    interacting with this page and get a result on the quiz that they like, and
    I believe it achieves that goal. </p>
