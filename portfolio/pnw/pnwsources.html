    <h3>About This Webpage </h3>
<p>This web page was made to act as a tourist activity service and it lists multiple different real summer time activities that can be done in the Pacific Northwest area. Coding wise, it was my first time using columns and divs that had real spacing, as well as a navigation bar. This was my first page that resembles the web pages that I make today, as it looks more organized and sophisticated. I included a navigation bar that changes when hovered over, and a logo image that can take the user to the home page, as well as many tables, images, and columns. Looking back I could have added more comments in the original code, and I could have made the form be usable with java script functionality. This web page is truly the first one that resembles my current pages through its fonts, navigation bar, rounded corners, and  formatting, making it a big step in the way I code.</p>
