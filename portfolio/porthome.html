<h3>Welcome to my portfolio!</h3>

  <p>
    Hi, my name is Morgan Eby. I am from Seattle Washington, I enjoy reading,
    studying physics, and playing tennis. I have a dog named Blue (seen on the left).

<br>
<br>

    Welcome to my portfolio, here you will find many of the web pages that I have
    created with some commentary on each project. I have taken one semester of web
    design and my web pages have grown a lot throughout this time, in this portfolio
    you will find a range of web pages with a range of complexity. The websites
    cover a variety of topics, from my ring collection to bringing awareness
    to endangered species. They also include a variety of coding languages,
    mainly HTML and CSS, there is also some Java Script. I hope you like my work.

<br>

    View web pages from the gallery, and reach out for more information from the contact section.</p>
