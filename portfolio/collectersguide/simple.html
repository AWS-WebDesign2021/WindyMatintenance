  <h2> Overview </h2>
  <p> This lovley simple embellished ring is from Pandora.
    It is a thin sliver band with small cubic zirconia stones spaced evenly across it.
     This ring is a classic and would work well for anyone, it is great for stacking and the
     stones shine greatly for their quality. Some small scratches have appeared but
     they are not noticable from a normal distance.  </p>

  <h2> Place in Collection </h2>
  <p> This ring is one of my absolute favorites,
    it is worn on my left middle finger and stacked on top of the pav√©d hearts ring.
    The cubic zarconia stones look great together. Like mentioned before,
    there is some small scratches but they are hardly visable after nine months of completely consistent use.     </p>

  <h3>About This Webpage </h3>
<p>This web pages was created to demonstrate the use of relative links and having multiple HTML files come together to be one web page. I choose to do this by creating a page that describes my ring collection. This was also one of my first times using CSS styles with distinct divisions and formatting. I tried out using borders, new fonts, and tables. It is a lot simpler than a web page I would make today and harder to navigate because there is no real navigation bar. Looking back something I would have done differently given those skills would be choosing colors that are easier to read. I also. Would have taken some more time to space the photos so that they look more organized. This web page does a good job at having multiple pages all with a cohesive style and meaning for being my first time trying to do that. </p>
