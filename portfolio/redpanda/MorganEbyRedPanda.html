  <h2> About Red Pandas </h2>

  <p>Red pandas are bear-like animals about the size of a
    house cat, they are from the eastern Himalayan region and can be found mainly
     around Nepal, Bhutan, and China. These small herbivores mostly live in the trees and
      use their long fluffy tails for balance when climbing. The sad issue with Red Pandas
      is that they are extremely endangered.</p>

<h2> Why Are They Endangered? </h2>

<!--This is an embedded video about red pandas that the user can watch within the page. -->

  <p>Red pandas are incredibly endangered,
    less than 10,000 of them are left in the wild.
     There main habitat of trees and bamboo is shrinking due to the area
      being cleared for things such as agriculture and deforestation.
      When Red Pandas are caught they are often trapped and killed or they are poached for their
      pelts. They are also threatened by other livestock and predators who encroach on their space.
      Overall, sadly over %40 of the Red Panda population has declined in the past twenty years,
      and desperately need help so that they donâ€™t go extinct.

  <h3>About This Webpage </h3>
<p>This webpage was made to bring awareness to an environmental issue, mine discusses
   the endangered animal the Red Panda. This was the first web page that I completed
    using CSS styles. I used a variety of colors and there was some spacing and formatting,
    however it is still a quite simple web page. Internal links were used to create a version
    of a navigation bar so that the user can move around the web page easily. The main thing
    I would change about this page is some of the formatting, the pictures and videos could
    have been places better and the text could use some padding. The page was still effective
    at talking about Red Pandas and the use of CSS gives it color and a better look. </p>
