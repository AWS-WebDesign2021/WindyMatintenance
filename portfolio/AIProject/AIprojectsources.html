    <h3>About This Webpage </h3>
<p>This web page was made to bring awareness to a complex ethical issue in tech, my web page was about artificial intelligence. It includes two different case studies and applications of AI and an overview of the topic. This web page was my first time working with a partner, which was an important learning experience for me in collaboration. It was also my first time using animations and transitions, there are two pictures that move back and forth, a bouncing title, and a transition that changes the color of a title. Looking back I think I could have been more intentional with my animations so that they feel more relevant to the topic, I also think I could have given it more organized formatting. This is also one of the more sophisticated pages that I have made, but the biggest impact that it made for me was working with another person, and learning about an important ethical issues. </p>
