    From ancient times, artificial intelligence has manifested itself in the forms of autonomous war machines, robotic servants, and even autonomous musicians. Now so, it takes the form of blood analyzing machines, self-driving cars, and the infamous human-cloned robots. AI, artificial intelligence, is defined by global tech corporation, International Business Machine, as “any human-like intelligence exhibited by a computer, robot, or other machine.” This understanding of AI really took off in the 1950’s after a report, Computing Machinery and Intelligence, by Alan Turing highlighted the inner workings of computer technology by tackling the question: can a machine think? In the following decades, machines would beat the best humans of their fields in calculation-based games including Go and Chess. Carrying through the rest of the 20th century, companies and startups continue to develop computer intelligence in every area of life: medicine, entertainment, infrastructure, etc. Today, there certainly is no sign of stopping the growth and presence of artificial intelligence in our everyday lives.

    <h3>About This Webpage </h3>
<p>This web page was made to bring awareness to a complex ethical issue in tech, my web page was about artificial intelligence. It includes two different case studies and applications of AI and an overview of the topic. This web page was my first time working with a partner, which was an important learning experience for me in collaboration. It was also my first time using animations and transitions, there are two pictures that move back and forth, a bouncing title, and a transition that changes the color of a title. Looking back I think I could have been more intentional with my animations so that they feel more relevant to the topic, I also think I could have given it more organized formatting. This is also one of the more sophisticated pages that I have made, but the biggest impact that it made for me was working with another person, and learning about an important ethical issues. </p>
