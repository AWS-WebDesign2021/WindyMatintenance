  <h2> About Red Pandas </h2>

  <p>Red pandas are bear-like animals about the size of a
    house cat, they are from the eastern Himalayan region and can be found mainly
     around Nepal, Bhutan, and China. These small herbivores mostly live in the trees and
      use their long fluffy tails for balance when climbing. The sad issue with Red Pandas
      is that they are extremely endangered.</p>

<h2> Why Are They Endangered? </h2>

  <p>Red pandas are incredibly endangered,
    less than 10,000 of them are left in the wild.
     There main habitat of trees and bamboo is shrinking due to the area
      being cleared for things such as agriculture and deforestation.
      When Red Pandas are caught they are often trapped and killed or they are poached for their
      pelts. They are also threatened by other livestock and predators who encroach on their space.
      Overall, sadly over %40 of the Red Panda population has declined in the past twenty years,
      and desperately need help so that they donâ€™t go extinct.
