  <h2> Overview </h2>
  <p> This beautiful pavéd ring is from Pandora. The entire outide of the
    ring is pavéd with small cubic zirconia stones and shines gorgeously.
    The band itself has small heart cut-outs that give the ring a cute unique look.
     One issue with these cut-outs is that they require cleaning more than many other rings.
      Overall this band is great on its own or stacked and is a perfect afordable pavéd option.</p>

  <h2> Place in Collection </h2>
  <p> This ring holds a special place in my collection as it was the first one
     I recived and was a graduation gift. It has held up perfectly over the time
      that I have had it. I wear it on my left middle finger stacked under the simple embellished ring.  </p>
