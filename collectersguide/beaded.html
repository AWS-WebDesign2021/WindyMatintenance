  <h2> Overview </h2>
  <p> This is a simple silver ring that has many small beaded circles.
    It is from Pandora and is great for stacking with other rings because of its classic look.
    Another pro is that its sleek slim shape means it is very easy to take on and off. </p>

  <h2> Place in Collection </h2>
  <p> This ring is one of my personal favorites, many times I have considered buying a second
    to stack with other rings. Currently it is worn on my right middle finger stacked with the pav√© wishbone ring.
    I have had it for over nine months and there are not signs of damage or tarnishing.  </p>
