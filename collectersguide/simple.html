  <h2> Overview </h2>
  <p> This lovley simple embellished ring is from Pandora.
    It is a thin sliver band with small cubic zirconia stones spaced evenly across it.
     This ring is a classic and would work well for anyone, it is great for stacking and the
     stones shine greatly for their quality. Some small scratches have appeared but
     they are not noticable from a normal distance.  </p>

  <h2> Place in Collection </h2>
  <p> This ring is one of my absolute favorites,
    it is worn on my left middle finger and stacked on top of the pav√©d hearts ring.
    The cubic zarconia stones look great together. Like mentioned before,
    there is some small scratches but they are hardly visable after nine months of completely consistent use.     </p>
