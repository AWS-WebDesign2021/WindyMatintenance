<h1>
  Recurring Dream
</h1>
<body>
  <p> One recurring dream that I have had involves bestfriends, summercamp, and
     creepy camp counslers. </p>
  <p> A friend and I, a differnt one each time, take a long walk through the
    woods to a summercamp overlooking a lake. The first time I had the dream the friend and
     I slowly realized the camp counslers had some sort of magical powers and were conspiring
     against the campers. </p>
  <p> The next time I had the dream, the friend and I arrived at the camp, and before the counslers could do anything, I
    remebered being there before and was able to save the camp before any havic was reaked. </p>
